Well I see you want to know more about me! My name is Jonah. I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of Maryland pursuing a BS in Computer Science with a minor in general business. In my free time I train for competetive running competitions, enjoy the outdoors, and bring ideas to life through programming!

Btw, I love classic rock ðŸŽ¸
