# About Me!
![image](./assets/abtImg.JPG){:height="100px" width="300px"}



Well I see you want to know more about me! My name is Jonah. I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of Maryland pursuing a BS in Computer Science with a minor in General Business. In my free time I train for competetive running competitions, enjoy the outdoors, and bring ideas to life through programming! I am currently working on manipulating large language models (LLM) to produce several advanced user tools.

Btw, I love classic rock ðŸŽ¸
